# Toggle LED GPIO with Flask
A simple web server that controls an LED on a Raspberry Pi using GPIO Zero - for Team Edge T2.

The templates folder conatins two more HTML files for instructional or demo useage:
- `main.html` which can be used to pass a date and a message to a client. The route in app.py still needs to be built for that.
- `motion.html` for use with a PIR motion sensor on a Pi. This is a starter for a Motion detector project that needs a route in `app.py` to be built.


Check out the [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library for more info on wiring and sample code.
